# Installation
If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the setup instructions.

Once Flutter is setup, you can use the latest stable channel:
```bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
```
Once on stable you're ready to run the app on your local device or simulator:
```bash
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d android
```
